Library Management System (Java – Console Based)
1. Introduction

The Library Management System is a console-based Java application designed to simulate the core operations of a real library.
The project focuses on applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in a clean, modular, and educational way, without using any graphical user interface.

This system allows managing books, periodicals, and customers, with the ability to borrow and return items under predefined rules.

2. System Overview (Three Main Steps)
🔹 Step 1: System Design & Class Structure

The system is built using a modular Object-Oriented design, where each real-world entity in the library is represented by a dedicated class.

Main Classes:

Book: Represents books in the library.

Periodical: Represents magazines and journals (inherits from Book).

Customer: Represents library users.

Library: Core controller that manages books and customers.

Main: Entry point of the application.

Each class has clearly defined attributes and methods, ensuring separation of responsibilities, code readability, and maintainability.

This step focuses on:

Identifying system entities

Defining relationships between classes

Applying inheritance where appropriate

🔹 Step 2: Core System Logic (Borrowing & Management)

This step implements the main functionality of the library system.

Book Management:

Adding and deleting books and periodicals

Checking book availability

Tracking borrowed books

Storing borrow dates

Customer Management:

Registering and deleting customers

Limiting the maximum number of books a customer can borrow

Tracking customer borrowing history

Borrow & Return Rules:

A book can only be borrowed if it is available

A customer cannot exceed the maximum borrowing limit

Borrowed books are moved to a borrowed list

Returned books are restored to the available list

This logic ensures data integrity and simulates real-world library rules.

🔹 Step 3: Data Review & Output (Console Interaction)

The final step focuses on reviewing and displaying system data through the console.

The system allows:

Printing all books and available books

Printing borrowed books and their details

Displaying customer information

Viewing borrowed books per customer

Each class contains customized print methods, ensuring clear and readable console output.

3. Classes Description
i) Book Class
1. Attributes

id: Unique identifier for the book.

name: Name of the book.

numberOfPages: Total number of pages.

author: Author name.

customerName: Name of the customer who borrowed the book.

isBookCanBorrowed: Indicates whether the book can be borrowed.

numberOfAvailableBooks: Total number of available copies.

isBookAvailable: Determines whether the book is currently available.

borrowDate: Date when the book was borrowed.

allBooks: List containing all books in the system.

borrowedBooks: List containing currently borrowed books.

2. Methods

getNumberOfAllBorrowedBooks(): Prints the number of borrowed books.

deleteBookOrPeriodical(Book b): Deletes a given book or periodical.

printBookInformation(): Prints book details.

printBorrowedBooksDetails(): Prints details of borrowed books.

printAllBooksNames(): Prints names of all books.

printAllAvailableBooksNames(): Prints names of available books only.

getBook(int bookId): Retrieves a book using its unique ID.

3. Constructors

Book(): Default constructor.

Book(String name, int pages, String author): Constructor with parameters.

ii) Customer Class
1. Attributes

id: Unique customer identifier.

firstName: Customer first name.

lastName: Customer last name.

phoneNumber: Customer phone number.

isCustomerAvailable: Indicates whether the customer is active.

numberOfAvailableCustomers: Total number of available customers.

maxNumberOfBooks: Maximum number of books a customer can borrow.

cart: List of books borrowed by the customer.

allCustomers: List of all customers.

borrowedCustomers: List of customers who have borrowed books.

2. Methods

setPhoneNumber(long phone): Sets customer phone number.

getPhoneNumber(): Returns customer phone number.

deleteCustomer(Customer c): Removes a customer from the system.

printCustomerInformation(): Prints customer details.

printAllCustomersName(): Prints all customers’ names.

printAllBorrowedCustomersName(): Prints names of customers who borrowed books.

printCustomerCart(): Prints borrowed books list.

borrowBook(Book b): Allows a customer to borrow a book.

returnBorrowBook(Book b): Returns a borrowed book.

getCustomer(int customerId): Retrieves customer by ID.

3. Constructors

Customer(): Default constructor.

Customer(String firstName, String lastName, long phoneNumber): Constructor with parameters.

iii) Periodical Class
1. Attributes

type: Type of periodical (e.g., magazine, journal).

Inherits all attributes from Book.

2. Methods

printBookInformation(): Overrides the Book method to display periodical-specific information.

3. Constructors

Periodical(): Default constructor.

Periodical(String name, int pages, String author, int type): Constructor with parameters.

4. Variables Dictionary
Variable Name	Type	Description
id	Integer	Unique identifier used across all classes
name	String	Stores item names
isBookBorrowed	Boolean	Determines if a book is borrowed
isAvailable	Boolean	Indicates if an item exists in the system
borrowDate	LocalDate	Stores the borrowing date
type	String	Periodical type
phoneNumber	Long	Customer phone number
numberOfBorrowedBooks	Integer	Number of borrowed books
maxNumberOfBooks	Integer	Maximum books allowed
cart	List<Book>	Borrowed books list
allCustomers	ArrayList<Customer>	All customers
borrowedCustomers	ArrayList<Customer>	Customers who borrowed books
allBooks	ArrayList<Book>	All books
borrowedBooks	ArrayList<Book>	Borrowed books
5. OOP Concepts Applied

Encapsulation: Sensitive data such as phone numbers are protected using getters and setters.

Inheritance: Periodical extends Book to reuse common behavior.

Abstraction: An abstract Menu class defines shared behavior without instantiation.

Polymorphism: Overridden methods provide customized behavior per class.

Modularity: Each class handles a single responsibility.

6. Conclusion

This project demonstrates how a real-world system can be modeled using Java and Object-Oriented Programming.
The clear structure, borrowing rules, and separation of concerns make the system easy to understand, maintain, and extend in the future.
